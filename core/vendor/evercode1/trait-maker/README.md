TraitMaker creates an artisan command that lets you quickly create a trait folder and trait stub.  If the folder already 
exists, you can use the command to place new traits in the exsiting folder.

## Install

Via Composer

```
composer require evercode1/trait-maker
```

In your app/config/app.php file, add the following to the providers array:

```
Evercode1\TraitMaker\TraitMakerServiceProvider::class,
```

## Usage

Once installed, you should see make:trait as one of the artisan commands when you run:

```
php artisan list
```

To use this command, supply it with two arguments, the first being the name of the trait, and the 
second being the name of the folder you want it to reside in.  If the folder does not exist, it will be created for you.

For example:

```
php artisan make:trait SampleTrait TraitsFolder
```

This would create a directory named TraitsFolder in your app directory with a php file
named SampleTrait.php, which would contain the following stub:
   
```
<?php
namespace App\TraitsFolder

trait SampleTrait
{

}
```

Please note, the package currently only supports trait folders that are in the app folder, for example:

```
app/MyTraits
```

It cannot be used to create the following location:

```
app/Http/Controllers/MyTraits
```
